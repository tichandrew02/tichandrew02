I am currently in my senior year, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics. My focus is on Software Engineering and Machine Learning. I am also working toward several verified certificates in Machine Learning, Azure Services, and iOS Development. I am passionate about AI and believe it can be leveraged across many applications to help companies increase productivity and profitability. Azure services and Swift programming for iOS development offer powerful tools for integrating AI services and visualizing data.

In addition to my academic workload of 18 credit hours, I am actively pursuing certifications in these areas. Outside of academics, I am an engaged member of the African Student Association (ASA). I also have a strong athletic background, having competed in the NCAA and represented my national rugby team for two years, experiences that taught me discipline, respect, and invaluable soft skills. I am passionate about using technology to drive positive change and make the world a better place. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect.
