- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tichandrew02 Currently, pursuing a Computer Science Bachelor's degree and a Minor in Mathematics. I specialize in Software Engineering and Machine Learning. I seek to attain several verified certificate courses in Artificial Intelligence as it amazes me and feel it can be used in many applications to make the world a better place. My main experience was interning at one of Southern Africa's biggest Beverage Companies. Delta Beverages. I am well conversant with SQL, Python, C++, SAP engineering, and more, I have worked on backend and front-end technologies like making APIs for internal and external work in Python and Node.js, and made websites for clients using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
I am also a big athlete having competed in the NCAA and playing Rugby for my National team for two years, something that taught me discipline and a number of useful soft skills. I am intrigued by the idea of intervention and making the world a better place, contact me if you wish to network.
